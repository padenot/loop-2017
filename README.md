# loop-2017

This is material I used to present at ableton loop 2017 in berlin.

The slides are in [index.html](https://padenot.github.io/loop-2017). The code that
was running is in [demo.html](https://padenot.github.com/loop-2017/demo.html)
(self-contained file).

I mentionned https://padenot.github.io/web-audio-perf at the end during the
Q&A, that is open for contributions/corrections.

This is all free for re-use (MIT). It was unclear where I got the convolution
impulse from, so I'm not putting it in this repository. Just drop an arbitrary
reverb impulse name `impulse.wav` at the root of the repo (for now there is one
but it's all zeros so it's not affecting the sound).
